# Ng GitHub Search

Ng GitHub Search is an Angular library that wraps the Github search API into convenient types and provides a service that constructs the search request for you.

> Please note that it only supports searching users as of now.

## Example Implementation.

You can find an example app that uses the library in the `src` folder. To run it, simply run `npm i`, than `npm start` and open [localhost:4800](http://localhost:4800).

The example app imitates the Google search UI a little bit and also uses some Material Icons, so thanks Google and I am sorry!

The app provides a nice example on how to abstract an API into a convenient user interface, so feel free to take inspiration!

> Please note that the app has only been tested in Google Chrome on a desktop computer as of now.

## TODOs

- Add tests!
- Add documentation.
- Unify naming conventions.
- Test and debug the example app.
- Improve the example app's design and accessibility.
- Responsiveness.
- Cross-browser testing.

## Future Work
- Support other endpoints apart from the user search.
